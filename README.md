# HPL
Bidding algorithm

The program will iterate through all the players, once the first round is finished, you will have to restart the program.
But this time you will have to enter in the edit mode, and give the information.

## Edit mode
If you type anything wrong, you can reset using the edit mode.

## Mistakes
If you have any mistakes, e.g. the player is not sold to our team, but you have mistakenly enter 'y', then you can just set the price to '0',
program will register it as a mistake. Unfortunately you have to be careful while answering 'Is he one of the D-cat player?', no exception
handling is done here.
